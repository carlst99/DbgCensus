# CHANGELOG

Date format: YYYY/MM/DD (ISO)

## 2024/11/30

#### Core-v3.1.0

- `ZoneID` now implements `IEquatable<ZoneID>, IEquatable<uint>`.
- Updated dependencies.

#### Rest-v4.0.0

- üö® Breaking Change: Removed of `CensusQueryOptions.ServiceIDs`, and associated service-id rotation behaviour. This
  has been noted to have no effect by the Census developers.
- üêõ Bugfix: `QueryBuilder.WithCustomParameter` no longer results in invalid query strings - thanks @bigwoke.
- `QueryBuilder` now allows `WithDistinctFieldValues` to be used with any other commands/filters.
- `QueryBuilder` no longer ignores `WithLimit` when `WithLimitPerDatabase` is specified.
- `QueryBuilder` has a new constructor that allows specifying the collection to query.
- New `IQueryBuilderFactory.Get` overload that allows specifying the collection to query.
- Updated dependencies.

## 2024/09/21

#### Core-v3.0.0

- üö® Breaking Change: The CamelCaseJsonNamingPolicy class has been removed, as it is no longer used internally.
It was an exceedingly domain-specific implementation, and should not have been `public`.

#### EventStream-v3.1.0

- Changed the JSON serialization of commands to use a proper camelCase property name converter. The existing
converter was PascalCase. This fixes compatibility with the NSS third-party Event-Stream wrapper.

#### EventHandlers-v3.8.0

- Added a parameter to `AddPayloadHandler` and `RegisterPreDispatchHandler` to allow changing the service lifetime under
which handlers are registered. See `Program.cs` in the ESS sample for a demonstration (which also fixes the 
`DuplicatePreventionPreDispatchHandler` being non-functional in the ESS sample).

## 2024/04/17

#### EventStream-v3.0.1, EventHandlers-v3.7.2

- Fixed a bug in the new `ReadOnlySequence`-based data processing that causes errors when deserializing JSON data
larger than the size of a single segment (4096 bytes).

## 2024/04/16 Update 2

#### EventStream-v3.0.0

üö® Breaking Change - The `BaseEventStreamClient.HandlePayloadAsync` method is now passed a `ReadOnlySequence<byte>`,
rather than a `MemoryStream`. Consumers will need to use other overloads of the System.Text.Json APIs to process the
data, or convert the sequence back into a stream using similar to the following logic:

```csharp
protected override async ValueTask HandlePayloadAsync(ReadOnlySequence<byte> data, CancellationToken ct)
{
    MemoryStream ms = new(data.ToArray());
    // ...
}
```

This change was made to remove the dependency on `Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream` while still retaining pooled
memory allocations in the `BaseEventStreamClient`.

#### EventHandlers-v3.7.1

- Update to support breaking change in **EventStream-v3.0.0**.

## 2024/04/16 Update 1

#### Core-v2.3.0

- Now compatible with Native AOT and trimming, via new APIs that support using `JsonTypeInfo`.
- Remove explicit target for net7.0.

#### EventStream-v2.9.0

- Guard against usage of `ClientWebSocket.Options.KeepAliveInterval` on browser platforms.
- Remove explicit target for net7.0.

#### EventHandlers-v3.7.0

- Remove explicit target for net7.0.

#### Rest-v3.9.0

- Now compatible with Native AOT and trimming, via new APIs that support using `JsonTypeInfo`.
- Remove unused `CensusRestClient.IsDisposed` property.
- Remove explicit target for net7.0.

## 2023/11/15

#### Core-v2.2.0, EventStream-v2.8.0, EventHandlers-v3.6.0, Rest-v3.8.0

- Added support for .NET 8.0.

## 2023/07/11

#### EventStream-v2.7.1

- Fixed `EventNames#PlayerLogout` pointing to the *PlayerLogin* event - thanks @thelostv.
- Fixed the thread-safety of `BaseEventStreamClient#SendCommandAsync`.
- `IEcho` and `IServiceMessage` now support covariant generics.

#### EventHandlers-v3.5.1

- Updated dependency on `DbgCensus.EventStream` to v2.7.1.
- Fixed *PlayerLogin* events being deserialized to `PlayerLogout` types when using the default 
event type registration - thanks @thelostv.

#### Rest-v3.7.1

- Improved pagination reliability on multi-database collections by using `WithLimitPerDatabase`.

## 17/03/2022

#### Rest-v3.0.0

- Added a service ID rotation Polly policy. Populate the `CensusQueryOptions.ServiceIDs` array with all service IDs that you want to rotate through, and they will be rotated in order when a Census REST request fails. May be useful if you are seeing a large number of connection resets.

## 12/03/2022

#### Rest-v2.2.3

- `CensusRestClient#GetPaginatedAsync` now breaks when the results count is less than the page size.

---

- Updated dependency on `DbgCensus.Core` to v1.3.0.

## 09/03/2022

#### EventStream-v2.3.1, EventStream.EventHandlers-v3.0.1

- Fixed `PlayerFacilityDefend` inheriting from the wrong interface

---

#### Rest-v2.2.0

- An exception is no longer thrown when deserializing multiple query elements to a non-enumerable type. The new behaviour is as follows:
  - A Census response containing no elements returns the `default` type.
  - A Census response containing only one element returns the deserialized value of that element.
  - A Census response containing multiple elements returns the deserialized value of the entire element array.
- Converted many `uint` parameters on query interfaces to `int`s.

---

#### EventStream.EventHandlers-v3.0.0

- Added the `DefaultPayloadDispatchService`, which implements the required logic for payload dispatching. This service is registered as a singleton and can be retrieved by injecting an `IPayloadDispatchService` instance.
- Correspondingly, the `EventHandlingEventStreamClient` no longer implements the `IPayloadDispatchService` interface.

#### Rest-v2.1.0

- `ICensusRestClient` no longer inherits from `IDisposable`.
- `CensusRestClient` now directly implements `IDisposable`.

## 08/03/2022

#### EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.4.0

- Fixed event dispatching!
- Added pre-dispatch event handlers.

---

#### EventStream-v2.3.0

- Added the `InstanceID` and `MetagameEventStateName` properties to `IMetagameEvent`.
- Added `EventNames#GetExperienceEventName` as a util to retrieve a valid event name for a given experience event ID.
- `BaseEventStreamClient#HandlePayloadAsync` now returns a ValueTask.

#### EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.3.1

- Updated dependency on DbgCensus.EventStream to v2.3.0

---

#### Core-v1.2.0

- Converted `ZoneId` to a readonly struct, using computed properties for the `Instance` and `Definition` properties.

#### EventStream-v2.2.0, EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.3.0

- Updated dependency on DbgCensus.Core to v1.2.0

## 07/03/2022

#### EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.2.0

- Added the IPayloadDispatchService interface, and implemented it in the EventHandlingEventStreamClient. This allows custom payloads to be dispatched.

#### EventStream-v2.1.0, EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.1.0

- Fixed `IEventStreamClientFactory#GetClient` when retrieving a client for a dedicated generic consumer.
- The `BaseEventStreamClient` now disposes of the data stream passed to `HandlePayloadAsync`.
- `BaseEventStreamClient#Name` is now a readonly-property.

#### Rest-v2.0.0

- The `JoinBuilder`, `TreeBuilder` and `QueryBuilder` types are now sealed.
- The `SearchModifier` enumeration is now a `short` data type.
- `StringUtils#SafeToString` now expects a generically-typed object, rather than an `object` parameter.

## 04/03/2022

#### EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.0.3

- Significant performance improvement to event dispatch by caching the retrieved `MethodInfo`.

## 03/02/2022

#### Core-v1.1.0, EventStream-v2.0.2, EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.0.2, Rest-v1.2.1

- Added Oshur zone and metagame event (meltdown only) definitions.

## 21/01/2022

#### EventStream-v2.0.1, EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.0.1

- Fix reconnection flow and improve start/stop logic
- Improve disposable implementation.

## 02/01/2022

#### EventStream-v2.0.0

- The `Characters` and `Worlds` properties on the `ISubscribe` command now use a `OneOf<>` object to be stricter about the type of subscription
you can make. The properties accept either the special `All` value, or a list of their corresponding type. E.g. the `Worlds` property has
a type of `OneOf<All, IEnumerable<WorldDefinition>>`.

- The way that the `JsonSerializerOptions` used by the `BaseEventStreamClient` are configured has changed. Rather than being properties of the
`EventStreamOptions` class, with configuration completed in the `BaseEventStreamClient` itself, the `JsonSerializerOptions` are now `Configure`d
as named options directly to the service collection. The name of these options can be found in the new `Constants` class.

- The `BaseEventStreamClient` now properly serializes commands that were passed as an interface type, rather than their concrete type.

- The `IEventStreamClient` interface no longer inherits from `IDisposable`.

- `BaseEventStreamClient` and `EventStreamClientFactory` now implement `IAsyncDisposable`. The `EventStreamClientFactory` now manages its clients
lifetimes.

#### EventStream.EventHandlers-v2.0.0

- The `EventHandlingEventStreamClient` now automatically refreshes its current subscription at the interval set by the `EventHandlingClientOptions.SubscriptionRefreshIntervalMilliseconds` property. This helps with scenarios where the event stream drops certain components of a subscription.

- Added `EventHandlingClientOptions`. This currently only contains the `SubscriptionRefreshIntervalMilliseconds` property, that can be used
to configure how frequently the `EventHandlingEventStreamClient` will refresh its current subscription. This property defaults to 15min.

- The `EventHandlingEventStreamClient` now dispatches an `IUnknownPayload` when a payload fails to deserialize and/or dispatch.

#### Rest-v1.2.0

- The way that the `JsonSerializerOptions` used by the `CensusRestClient` are configured has changed. Rather than being properties of the
`CensusQueryOptions` class, the `JsonSerializerOptions` are now `Configure`d as named options directly to the service collection.
The name of these options can be found in the new `Constants` class.
